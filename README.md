# Halifax PlayScraper

This began as an exercise to understand the art of webscraping. It's a webscraper which collects data from several Halifax, Nova Scotia theatres on current and upcoming plays and stores that in a json database. 

The ultimate goal is to build a bot which can tweet this information regularly when new things are about to happen.
